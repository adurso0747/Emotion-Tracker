# Emotion-Tracker

Emotion-Tracker is a python program which processes images and sends them to be processed by the Microsoft emotion API. Then it displays a picture with a prediction of the emotion presented in the picture. Emotion-Tracker supports choosing a pre existing picture, or take a picture with your webcam to be processed.
